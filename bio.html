    <p id="p2"> Charlotte has worked for decades as an artist, teacher, and curriculum developer. After five years of faith-based international aid work, Charlotte is back in the U.S.A. and shifting focus to bring her experiences to the field of coding and web-development. She hopes that, through the power of programming, she can make art and educational opportunities available to all and improve people's lives in the process. </p>
    <p id="p3">"Nothing is wasted; each thing you do leaves an impression and helps build you toward something new."   Love, Charlotte</p>
